# Mongo Basics

This repo contains code for the tasks given at the backend track for StartNG 2020. 

## Installation
Clone or download the repo. Then run 
```shell
npm  i
```
After installing all dependencies, run the server
```shell
npm start
```
You may need to run the code written in the js files.  Do that by
```shell
node js/mongo_db
```
```shell
node js/interns_collection
```
Running those two commands would create a database and insert a collection named interns in the database.
